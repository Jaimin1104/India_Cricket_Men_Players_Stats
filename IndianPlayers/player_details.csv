Virat Kohli;18;https://www.bcci.tv/players/164/virat-kohli;Batsman;Right-hand Bat;Right-arm Medium;https://www.facebook.com/virat.kohli;https://twitter.com/imVkohli;https://www.instagram.com/virat.kohli;Nov 05, 1988;Virat Kohli had a dream. A dream like every other young kid in India to represent the country in the gentleman’s game. It is this vigor and fervor for the game of cricket that has helped this extremely talented young boy from Delhi to scale great heights at a very young age. He was barely in his teens when he led the India Under-19 team to a World Cup victory in Kuala Lumpur in 2008 which was a pointer of bigger and better things to come in the future. After that famous victory, it was not long before he made his entry into the senior team and Kohli was soon brushing shoulders with the best in the business and his cricketing idol Sachin Tendulkar. The stylish right-handed batsman banked on the opportunities at disposal and displayed a tremendous sense of maturity as if to show he belonged. He was termed brash and aggressive for being expressive on and off the field, but Kohli imbibed all of those qualities in his gameplay only to become better with each passing game. He began chasing totals for India with ridiculous ease and India had found a stable batsman in the middle order for the long run. Such is his batting prowess and cricketing mind that Ray Jennings(his coach with Royal Challengers Bangalore) touted him to be the leader of future India. Kohli made his mark in the shorter formats of the game but got a chance to don the whites in 2011. He registered his maiden Test century against Australia in Adelaide in January 2012 and followed it up with impressive centuries in India and abroad - namely South Africa and New Zealand.

Chahar, who began his journey in international cricket with a T201 international, became the first Indian bowler (in men's cricket) to take a T20I hat-trick in November 2019. Chahar returned with the figures of 6/7 in that match against Bangladesh and this performance helped him win ICC's 2019 T201 Performance of the Year award.

After displaying his prowess with the bat and the ball for Kings XI Punjab, Patel earned his maiden ODI call up the same year in a 3-match ODI series against Bangladesh.

The right-handed batsman, who can also double up as an occasional off-spinner, made his India debut during the England series in September in 2018 after averaging nearly 60 in First Class cricket. In his seven-match old Test career so far, he has scored three fifties, a hundred and have picked up five wickets.
Yuzvendra Chahal;3;https://www.bcci.tv/players/111/yuzvendra-chahal;Bowler;Right-hand Bat;Right-arm Leg-spin;https://www.facebook.com/tossco9.yuzi23;https://twitter.com/yuzi_chahal;https://www.instagram.com/yuzi_chahal23;Jul 23, 1990;It is not easy for a spinner to find success in the shorter formats of the game where batsmen have the license to smash the ball around. The leg spinner is not afraid to flight the ball and has troubled many of the world's best with his guile. After his successful stints with the RCB, Chahal was picked for India's tour to Zimbabwe in 2016 and made his ODI and T201 debuts. A year later, he bamboozled the English line-up in Bengaluru. He became the first bowler from India to pick six wickets in a T201 and just the second after Ajantha Mendis (twice), to achieve the feat. With eight wickets in the series, he picked up both Man of the Match and Man of the Series awards.
Mohammed Siraj;13;https://www.bcci.tv/players/3840/mohammed-siraj;Bowler;Right-hand Bat;Right-arm Medium Fast;https://www.facebook.com/MohammedSirajofficials;https://twitter.com/mdsirajofficial;https://www.instagram.com/mohammedsirajofficial;Mar 13, 1994;Mohammed Siraj's rise as a seamer was remarkably swift. The son of an autorickshaw driver in Hyderabad, he only began playing the game in class seven. It was in 2015 that he first bowled with a cricket ball. In 2017, he bagged an IPL contract worth INR 2.6 crore. Months later, he was wearing an India shirt and bowling in a T20 international against New Zealand.Sturdy and athletic, Siraj has a deceptive run-up, which initially suggests that a left-arm bowler is steaming in. He is, however, a right-armer and by his own admission is a natural at getting the ball to swing into the right-hander. He has always been able to bowl a pretty quick bouncer though, something that had impressed his captain David Warner and team mentor VVS Laxman in the Sunrisers Hyderabad set-up. Potential translated to performance when he was his state's highest wicket-taker playing only his second season of Ranji Trophy - 41 wickets in nine matches. He was subsequently picked to play for the Rest of India and was brought on board by the India A team as well for a tour of South Africa in July-August 2017. The step up to the big league arrived soon after.

The stylish right-hander made his India debut in January 2019 in Hamilton.
Navdeep Saini;96;https://www.bcci.tv/players/3824/navdeep-saini;Bowler;Right-hand Bat;Right-arm Medium Pace;https://www.facebook.com/Navdeep-Saini/100005000583658;https://twitter.com/navdeepsaini96;https://www.instagram.com/navdeep_saini10_official;Nov 23, 1992;Tall, fast and sharp. Navdeep Saini has been a welcome addition to India’s pace-bowling arsenal. The right-arm pacer made it to the Indian side on the back of solid showings for Delhi. Saini made a memorable debut, winning a Man of the Mach award following his three-wicket haul against West Indies in August 2019.
Bhuvneshwar Kumar;15;https://www.bcci.tv/players/116/bhuvneshwar-kumar;Bowler;Right-hand Bat;Right-arm Medium Fast;https://www.facebook.com/KumarBhuvneshwar;https://twitter.com/bhuviofficial;https://www.instagram.com/imbhuvi;Dec 05, 1990;Bhuvneshwar Kumar belongs to that breed of bowlers who can swing the ball prodigiously both ways at a decent pace. There has often been the talk of “had he been a few yards faster, he could have been lethal” but that has never been an area of concern for him as he realizes his limitations as a bowler and believes in focussing on his skill set rather than pace. He is often compared to his fellow UP seamer Praveen Kumar who hogged the limelight for swinging the ball considerably beating the best in the business during his hay days. Representing Uttar Pradesh in the domestic circuit, Bhuvneshwar Kumar was known for his smart cricketing brain and being a captain's go-to bowler. His efforts reaped benefits as he made his ODI debut in 2012 against Pakistan.Kumar impressed everyone as he got a wicket in his very first ball of his first over in ODIs sending Mohammad Hafeez back to the pavilion with an outstanding in-swinger. Kumar later ended up with figures of 2/27 in nine overs with an economy of three. Kumar's rise in international cricket has been impressive since then as he got a Test call-up in 2013 against Australia. Still early days in international cricket for the seamer, but Kumar has already shown his tremendous potential with the bat and ball. He does have a first-class century to his name and has shown immense confidence batting lower down the order for India. He was impressive in his first overseas tour to England and even got his name on the Lord's Honours Board picking up a 6-wicket haul in the second Test against England in 2014.
Kuldeep Yadav;23;https://www.bcci.tv/players/261/kuldeep-yadav;Bowler;Left-hand Bat;Left-arm Wrist Spin;https://www.facebook.com/CircleofCricket.KuldeepYadav;https://twitter.com/imkuldeep18;https://www.instagram.com/kuldeep_18;Dec 14, 1991;That Kuldeep Yadav took up spin bowling after harbouring fast bowling ambitions as a kid is well known. Ever since he turned into a chinaman bowler – a rather rare commodity – life has changed for the 19-year old. From bowling to the local boys at the nets in a silent corner in Kanpur to brushing shoulders with the best in the business in the Indian dressing room, Kuldeep has come a long way. Right since his U-19 days, Yadav has shown a lot of promise with his variations with the ball. He boasts of bamboozling Sachin Tendulkar in one of the net sessions when he was part of the Mumbai Indians setup. Yadav then moved to kolkata Knight Riders harbouring hopes of a game in the IPL but it was only in the Champions League T20 that he got his chance to prove a point.Yadav was economical and played perfect foil to Sunil Narine earning him praise from the cricketing circuit. He was included in India's ODI squad for the series against West Indies in October 2014 but didn't get a game there. He made his first-class debut that year in the Duleep Trophy representing Central Zone and picked up three wickets along with a half century with the bat.
Mayank Agarwal;16;https://www.bcci.tv/players/158/mayank-agarwal;Batsman;Right-hand Bat;Right-arm-offspin;https://www.facebook.com/MayankIndia;https://twitter.com/mayankcricket;https://www.instagram.com/mayankagarawal;Feb 16, 1991;After plundering runs in the domestic cricket for Karnataka and for India ‘A’, Mayank Agarwal made his India debut during the third Test against Australia in Melbourne in December 2018. The right-hander did not waste any time making an impression, scoring 76 in his first innings in the international cricket. Such has been his performances with the bat over the last one year that he was picked in the 2019 ICC's Test Team of the Year.
Wriddhiman Saha;6;https://www.bcci.tv/players/16/wriddhiman-saha;Wicket-keeper Batsman;Right-hand Bat;-;https://www.facebook.com/WriddhiPops;https://twitter.com/wriddhipops;https://www.instagram.com/wriddhi;Oct 24, 1984;Agile behind the wickets and a batsman who believes in playing freely, Wriddhiman Saha burst into the cricketing scene when he scored a century in his Ranji Trophy debut. He is amongst the brightest hopes from the state of Bengal who is looked at as someone with immense potential. His breakthrough in international cricket was accidental. He was drafted in the Indian side as a specialist batsman replacing Rohit Sharma who injured himself on the morning of the Test match against South Africa in 2010. He made a fighting 36 in the second innings of that Test but that was not worthy enough for Saha to be a regular in the Indian line-up. He then played a Test for India two year later against Australia at Adelaide scoring a patient 35 giving Virat Kohli company and helped him score his maiden Test century. Saha however was a revelation in the IPL for the Kings XI Punjab scoring the way he liked and at a brisk pace. He is now a vital cog in the Kings XI batting line-up and has earned himself a reputation of scoring runs at will. He set the stage on fire with a feisty century in the IPL final against Kolkata Knight Riders in 2014 but rated his knock of 35 in Adelaide higher than his recently attained T20 accolade.
Hardik Pandya;33;https://www.bcci.tv/players/2740/hardik-pandya;All-rounder;Right-hand Bat;Right-arm Medium Fast;#;#;javascript:void(0);Oct 11, 1993;If there is one thing that separates Hardik Pandya from other young cricketers, it is his immense self-belief. The flamboyant Baroda all-rounder never lets pressure affect his game, but instead relishes such situations. A big hitter and a fast-bowling all-rounder, Hardik ticks all the boxes that a team desires from an all-rounder. It was no surprise that he was fast tracked into the Indian ODI and T20 side after a successful run in the IPL 2015. Hardik has worked both on batting and bowling, to secure the spot of the all-rounder. His sharp fielding makes him a complete package. Hardik has been a part of India's Test squad and it is only a matter of time before he appears for India in the longest format too.
Shardul Thakur;54;https://www.bcci.tv/players/1745/shardul-thakur;Bowler;Right-hand Bat;Right-arm Medium Pace;https://www.facebook.com/;https://twitter.com/imshard;https://www.instagram.com/shardul_thakur;Oct 16, 1991;An aggressive quick bowler, who can swing the ball away from the right-handers even while hitting the pitch hard, Shardul Thakur has established himself as the spearhead of Mumbai's attack. With the new ball, Thakur's at-the-batsman method forms a neat counterpoint to Dhawal Kulkarni's more metronomic style, and the two combined brilliantly to win Mumbai their 41st Ranji Trophy title in February 2016. Thakur picked up eight wickets in the final against Saurashtra, and his dismissal of Cheteshwar Pujara on the third day, the ball rearing up from a length to hit the shoulder of the bat, was perhaps the ball of the match. Thakur hails from Palghar, a town 87 km north of Mumbai, and spent his early cricketing years lugging his kitbag on early-morning trains into the city. Mumbai won the Ranji Trophy in his debut season of 2012-13, but he did not play a major role in the triumph, picking up only four wickets in four matches at an average of 82. Told to lose weight by his Mumbai team-mates, Thakur came back leaner and fitter the next season, and picked up 27 wickets at 26.25. The 2014-15 season was even better, Thakur finishing joint-top of the Ranji Trophy bowling charts with 48 wickets at 20.81. That earned him a call-up to the India A squad for four-day games against Australia A and South Africa A. Later that year, playing for the Board President's XI, he bagged a four-wicket haul against the touring South Africans, his wickets including those of Faf du Plessis and Hashim Amla. Kings XI Punjab signed Thakur for INR 20 lakhs at the 2014 IPL player auction, but he only got to play one match in his first two seasons for the team.
Umesh Yadav;19;https://www.bcci.tv/players/59/umesh-yadav;Bowler;Right-hand Bat;Right-arm Fast;https://www.facebook.com/yadavumesh;https://twitter.com/y_umesh;https://www.instagram.com/umeshyaadav;Oct 25, 1987;From the rural parts of Vidharbha, India saw the birth of a genuine fast bowler who could bowl consistently close to 140 kmph. The son of a coal miner, Umesh Yadav took to the game only at the age of 19. Blessed with an innate ability to bowl fast, he soon made his debut for Vidharbha in 2008 and found himself bowling to some of the big names in Indian cricket on the Ranji circuit. He made his international debut in 2009 for a tri series in Zimbabwe. He did not have the best of starts to his career, but the need for speed and want for a quick bowler kept him in fray for national selection. He later had a reasonable ODI home series in England but he impressed the most when he was picked in the Test side for a series against West Indies. His ability to swing the ball both ways at a lethal pace earned him a place in the India squad for the Australia series and in an otherwise dismal series for India, was the few plus points for India picking up 14 wickets in four games. However, injuries and inconsistency kept him out of the India squad and he still remains India's hopeful of a speedster for the future.
Ishant Sharma;97;https://www.bcci.tv/players/38/ishant-sharma;Bowler;Right-hand Bat;Right-arm Fast;https://www.facebook.com/IshantSharmaIND;https://twitter.com/imishant;https://www.instagram.com/ishant.sharma29;Sep 02, 1988;At a time when there was a dearth of genuine fast bowlers in India, Ishant Sharma was like a breath of fresh air as he burst into the limelight with his sharp pace and accurate bowling. You turn back the pages of cricketing history and one would have enduring memories of the lanky bowler making look batting miserable for Ricky Ponting. His seven-over spell in the second innings of the Perth Test of 2008 is one of his most talked about spells by an Indian bowler as an Australian legend had been trumped by a youngster playing just his fourth Test. Ishant's honeymoon period in Australia continued as he helped India win the last ever annual Tri-series ODI competition down under baggin the most wickets for the visitors. But since his initial success, Ishant has struggled to make a sustained impact because of injury woes. Yet, whenever he has been brought back into the Indian Test side, his contributions have been steady. The 2010 series against Australia and New Zealand in 2010 at home is a case in point. His ability to generate bounce from his height makes him a vital asset for India's overseas tours, particularly those played outside the subcontinent. Sharma is also known for being a stubborn lower-order bat. He showed a lot of commitment with the bat teaming up with VVS Laxman in 2010 to register an iconic win against Ausralia in Mohali. He has often received a lot of criticism for being inconsistent even after playing more than fifty Test matches for India. For Ishant though it is a constant learning process and the road to success will definitely come his way. In 2014, he took center stage with a seven-wicket haul against England at Lord's which helped India win at the Home of Cricket after 28 years. In Ishant there is hope and a constant prayer for him to be India's next leader of the pace attack.
Kl Rahul;1;https://www.bcci.tv/players/1125/kl-rahul;Batsman;Right-hand Bat;-;https://www.facebook.com/klrahul11;https://twitter.com/klrahul11;https://www.instagram.com/www.instagram.com/rahulkl;Apr 18, 1992;Young KL Rahul is amongst the most talented opening batsmen in India’s next generation setup. He was a part of India's squad in the 2010 Under-19 World Cup and made his first-class debut later that year. He has never been one of those cricketers who has set the stage on fire or has been the talk of the town for his batting skills. Rahul has taken gentle strides over the years and made a name for himself for being a consistent performer in the domestic circles. He enjoyed a breakthrough 2013-14 season, laying the foundation for Karnataka's Ranji Trophy victory with 1033 runs, which included three centuries, three nineties, and a Man-of-the-Match performance in the final. Not surprisingly, Rahul attracted a lot of bids in the IPL player auctions and ended up with the Sunrisers Hyderabad in the 2014 season. He has received much praise from some of the legends of the game namely Rahul Dravid. His consistent performances in India's A tour of Australia and the 2014-15 domestic season earned him a Test call up for India's tour of Australia.
Rishabh Pant;17;https://www.bcci.tv/players/2972/rishabh-pant;Wicket-keeper Batsman;Left-hand Bat;-;#;#;javascript:void(0);Oct 04, 1997;At a tender age, Rishabh Pant has gone through all the highs and lows of a cricketing career. A promising talent from Delhi, Pant came into the lime-light after his batting heroics for India Under-19 in the 2016 WorldCup. A dashing left-handed wicket-keeper batsman, he lit up the tournament with a glitzy 24-ball 75, the fastest half-century of the tournament, against Nepal and followed it up with a century against Namibia. Incidentally, his century came on the same day when he was bought by Delhi Daredevils for INR 1.9 crores from a base price of Rs 10 lakhs. A year after making his Ranji Trophy debut at the age of 18 in 2015, Pant broke records by scoring a triple-hundred against Maharashtra and a blistering 48-ball hundred against Jharkhand in the 2016-17 first-class season. In January 2017, he was rewarded with a call-up to India's T20 squad for the three home matches against England.
Mohammad Shami;11;https://www.bcci.tv/players/94/mohammad-shami;Bowler;Right-hand Bat;Right-arm Fast-medium;https://www.facebook.com/CircleofCricket.MDShami;https://twitter.com/mdshami11;https://www.instagram.com/mdshami.11;Sep 03, 1990;Born in a remote village in Uttar Pradesh, Mohammad Shami was recognized as a special talent and after a tough grind through the ranks, he got his chance to represent Bengal at the Ranji level. After his remarkable performances in domestic cricket, Shami slowly made his way into the international team in 2013 when he made his ODI debut. His ability to reverse swing the old white ball made him an indispensable asset in the limited-overs format. He made a mark in 2015 World Cup held in Australia by taking 17 wickets and ending  up as one of the highest wicket-takers in the tournament. It was later revealed that he played the World Cup through a knee injury. Shami then made his debut in the red ball cricket against West Indies in a home series and in the two-match series; he to took 11 wickets. In the summer that followed in England, Shami and Bhuvneshwar Kumar, recorded the second-highest 10th wicket partnership for India in Tests, when they put on 111 runs against England in Nottingham.
Shikhar Dhawan;42;https://www.bcci.tv/players/41/shikhar-dhawan;Batsman;Left-hand Bat;-;#;#;javascript:void(0);Dec 05, 1985;Behind the earring, the famous twirled moustache and those intricately inked biceps, is a very soft-spoken man – Shikhar Dhawan. From a simple cricket-loving youngster going through the grind of domestic cricket to taking the cricketing world by frenzy by scoring the fastest century on Test debut, Dhawan has come a long way. The road to success has not been easy for the left-handed batsman from Delhi as he toiled his way in the domestic circuit year after year only to receive a Test call-up in his ninth year of first-class cricket. The opening batsman scored in plenty but those only made for good reading for the men in love with numbers. India had a stable opening combination in Virender Sehwag and Gautam Gambhir and Dhawan had to wait for his chance to breakthrough in the big league. When he did get his chance, he grabbed the opportunity with both hands. Such was his dominance in his approach on his Test debut that Dhawan became the talk of the town after treating the Aussie bowlers with utter disdain. He smashed 187 off 174 balls which changed the course of the game completely resulting in India winning the Test comprehensively by six wickets. Following his good run, Dhawan was picked in India's squad for the Champions Trophy. He ended up being the player of the series with 363 runs in five matches at an outstanding average of 90. He hit two centuries in the tournament and was credited for India's success in the tournament. He was also named player of the series and awarded the gold bat for his stellar batting show.
Ajinkya Rahane;27;https://www.bcci.tv/players/135/ajinkya-rahane;Batsman;Right-hand Bat;-;https://www.facebook.com/ajinkyarahaneofficial;https://twitter.com/ajinkyarahane88;https://www.instagram.com/ajinkyarahane;Jun 06, 1988;Ajinkya Rahane is an example of a batsman from the traditional mould with a typical script of a Mumbai lad with a dream of making it big in the game of cricket. Like most Mumbai boys, Rahane too had a unique love for cricket and the childhood dream of representing the country one day. He belongs to the list of already famous Mumbai batsmen who were prolific in the domestic circuit and represented the country at some point of time. Discipline and dedication are two features one would associate Rahane with, the two qualities that every sportsman needs to excel in sport. Season after season Rahane did all that he could - score and score big; with a view to catch the right eyeballs. His dream to don the Indian jersey finally came true in India's tour to England in 2011 wherein he scored a half century in five ODI innings. He showed confidence and promise in that tour and was given an olive branch to be a part of the Indian batting line-up in the series to follow. Rahane's temperament was gifted with a Test call-up in 2013 against Australia and the middle-order batsman replied in kind with gutsy knocks overseas. He felt agonisingly short of his maiden Test century by four runs in a fighting knock against South Africa in Durban but he made amends and recorded a century against New Zealand in Wellington. His moment of glory though came in 2014 when he batted out of his skin on a green top against England at Lord's. That innings defined his character, hunger for runs and willingness to succeed as Rahane looks to cement a permanent spot in that Indian middle-order.
Cheteshwar Pujara;25;https://www.bcci.tv/players/156/cheteshwar-pujara;Batsman;Right-hand Bat;Right-arm Leg-spin;#;#;javascript:void(0);Jan 25, 1988;One often relates adjectives like principles, dedication, hardwork and patience to one of India’s batting mainstays - Rahul Dravid. After Dravid hung up his boots, these words found a new meaning in Cheteshwar Pujara, someone who went through the rigours of domestic cricket scoring mammoth individual scores on the flat tracks of Rajkot and Saurasthra. When Pujara scored a ton, he wouldn’t stop there; he would take a fresh guard after his milestone and concentrate on every ball to convert his hundreds into daddy hundreds. Even before he made his Test debut in 2010 against Australia, Pujara had already scored a triple century and a couple of double centuries. His first-class career was exceptional with 26 centuries and over 8000 runs with an average of more than 60. Such was his caliber as a batsman that the expectations from him were huge even before he took his initial steps in international cricket. On his Test debut, he scored a vital 72 in the second innings against Australia in Bengaluru when India were chasing 207. His gritty knock won him applause and Pujara was touted as the next No.3 for India after Rahul Dravid's exit. Pujara did realise that those were big shoes to fill but he showcased his eagerness and hunger for big scores every time he walked out to bat. He has the game and technique to tire out oppositions, bat time and score runs in the process.His back-foot punch, the sweep shot and the cover drive are like poetry in motion; a visual treat for every cricket enthusiast. He showed a lot of steel when India toured South Africa in 2013 as he notched up his first overseas ton against the likes of Dale Steyn and Morne Morkel. Though known for his heroics in the longer format of the game, Pujara has not been able to make it in the mix in ODIs. Many place him in high regard even in the shorter formats of the game and believe he could be India's key player in ODIs abroad.
Ravindra Jadeja;8;https://www.bcci.tv/players/9/ravindra-jadeja;All-rounder;Left-hand Bat;Slow Left-arm Orthodox;https://www.facebook.com/ImRavindraJadeja;https://twitter.com/imjadeja;https://www.instagram.com/ravindra.jadeja;Dec 06, 1988;He was termed as “The Rockstar” by Shane Warne when Ravindra Jadeja took the Indian Premier League by storm in 2008 with his all-round heroics. An eccentric fielder, a more than handy left-arm spinner and a fearless batsman, Jadeja had all the qualities of a utility cricketer. Though predominantly known for his performances for the Rajasthan Royals in the IPL, not many notice his efforts in the longer format of the game. The left-handed batsman has three triple centuries to his name with a first-class average close to 50. He paved his way to the national side amassing 739 runs and 42 wickets in the 2008-09 Ranji season. He made his ODI debut in 2009 against Sri Lanka and has been a key player in the Indian since.It took him three more years after his ODI debut to make it into the Test side and India now see him as a good variety in the bowling attack and more than a handy bat lower down the order. International cricket aside, Jadeja has also been a vital cog in the wheel for his IPL franchise - Chennai Super Kings. He was purchased for a whopping sum by the franchise in 2012 and has been one of their marquee players ever since.
Ravichandran Ashwin;99;https://www.bcci.tv/players/8/ravichandran-ashwin;Bowling All-rounder;Right-hand Bat;Right-arm-offspin;https://www.facebook.com/AshwinRaviOfficial;https://twitter.com/ashwinravi99;https://www.instagram.com/rashwin99;Sep 17, 1986;R Ashwin shot to limelight after an impressive season for the Chennai Super Kings in the India Premier League in 2010. His ability to thrive on crunch situations and bowl with variety caught the eye of the selectors who saw in him a potential to be India’s lead spinner in the future. Though Ashwin started off his career as a top-order batsman for Tamil Nadu, he bagged wickets at will in the domestic circuit. He donned the Indian jersey in 2010 and dumbfounded the best in the business with his skill and variations with the ball. Often known to add something new to his armory and experiment with his bowling, Ashwin later came up with the carrom ball; avariation that was initiated by Ajantha Mendis of Sri Lanka; a variation he tried to master while bowling at the nets. Through the years Ashwin has been India's key spinner in Tests and ODIs at home with a remarkable amount of success. He impressed one and all with impressive showings against West Indies and Australia at home wherein he showcased his batting prowess as well. At a time when there is a dearth of all-rounders in India, many feel R Ashwin is the answer who has two Test hundreds to his name. He has the technique, the timing and the shots in his book, but Ashwin has time and again reiterated the fact of trying to be India's most successful bowler first and then a batsman. With a sharp mind, a cool head on his shoulders and a good work ethic, Ashwin is an integral part of the Indian line-up.
Jasprit Bumrah;93;https://www.bcci.tv/players/1124/jasprit-bumrah;Bowler;Right-hand Bat;Right-arm Fast;https://www.facebook.com/JaspritJBumrah;https://twitter.com/jaspritbumrah93;https://www.instagram.com/jaspritb1;Dec 06, 1993;MS Dhoni called him the ‘find of the tour’ after the bilateral T20I series against Australia that India won 3-0. For long, India had struggled to find a bowler who could be effective in the death overs. Dhoni's long search finally ended when Bumrah answered his calls with his ability to bowl yorkers. While the yorker is his most potent weapon, Bumrah's unorthodox action makes it very difficult for batsmen to read him. If the IPL is all about spotting Indian talent and giving them the platform, the credit for Bumrah's rapid rise must go to Mumbai Indians. It was John Wright, who spotted him in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy and drafted him into the squad. Bumrah has shown improvement in every edition and the presence of Lasith Malinga has been an added advantage. The Sri Lankan star has backed his strength and boosted his confidence. The master of yorkers has passed on his experience and the young Bumrah has benefited immensely.
Rohit Sharma;45;https://www.bcci.tv/players/107/rohit-sharma;Batsman;Right-hand Bat;Right-arm-offbreak;https://www.facebook.com/RohitSharmaOfficialPage;https://twitter.com/ImRo45;https://www.instagram.com/rohitsharma45;Apr 30, 1987;Popularly known as the Hitman for his hard hitting skills, Rohit Sharma is a gifted batsman and an immensely talented cricketer who is pleasing on the eye with his elegance and ability to time the ball. Each time Rohit Sharma walks out to bat, the word “talent” features more often than not amongst his fans and the cricketing circles. Rohit Sharma got off to a good start in his international career with crucial contributions in the T20 World Cup in 2007 and the CB Series in Australia. He almost made his Test debut in 2010 against South Africa but he injured himself on the morning of the Test match; Rohit would then have to wait for three more years to finally represent India in whites. Rohit continued to take giant strides in the shortest format of the game and attracted a lot of attention by achieving success in the IPL. He also led the Mumbai Indians to their maiden IPL title in 2013. His inconsistency for the national side though saw him in and out of the Indian team until he got a chance to feature in India's tour of the Caribbean in 2011. Rohit proved to be a revelation there and bagged the Man-of-the-series award. He later had an on and off career graph stringing in useful contributions for India in ODIs. He was then promoted to open the innings, a move that proved to be a masterstroke for India as Rohit began to prove his critics wrong batting with a lot of freedom and exuberance. He scored an ODI double century against Australia in Bengaluru; a feat that was achieved by Sachin Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag before. In 2013 he made his Test debut against West Indies in Kolkata and straight away made an impression with a century as if to say he belonged. He followed it up with yet another century in Mumbai against the same opposition which paved way for his entry into the Test side more frequently. He did have a poor run overseas but these are still early days in his Test career and India see a lot of potential in him in Tests as well.
